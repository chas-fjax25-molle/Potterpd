                <h3>Discover the magical universe created by J.K. Rowling.</h3>
                <p>
                    The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a hidden magical society existing
                    alongside the non-magical world. Founded on centuries of tradition, magic, and
                    secrecy, it includes institutions like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and
                    Wizardry, the Ministry of Magic, and magical villages such as Hogsmeade. Wizards
                    and witches live in secrecy to protect their world from Muggles, using spells,
                    magical creatures, and enchanted objects in their daily lives.

                <h3>The Boy Who Lived and his legendary journey.</h3>
                <p>
                    Harry Potter is a young wizard famous for surviving an attack by the dark wizard
                    Lord Voldemort as a baby. Raised by his non-magical relatives, Harry discovers
                    on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and begins attending Hogwarts.
                    Throughout seven years at school, he faces danger, friendship, loss, and destiny
                    while uncovering the truth about his past and his connection to Voldemort.

                <h3>The most prestigious school of witchcraft and wizardry.</h3>
                <p>
                    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is located in Scotland and serves as
                    the primary magical education institution in Britain. Students are sorted into
                    four houses: Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff. They study
                    subjects such as Potions, Transfiguration, Defense Against the Dark Arts, and
                    Herbology. The castle itself is filled with moving staircases, enchanted
                    ceilings, and hidden secrets.

                <h3>The darkest wizard of modern times.</h3>
                <p>
                    Born Tom Marvolo Riddle, Lord Voldemort sought immortality and ultimate power.
                    He created Horcruxes—dark magical objects containing pieces of his soul—to avoid
                    death. As the leader of the Death Eaters, he waged war against the wizarding
                    world, promoting pure-blood supremacy. His conflict with Harry Potter forms the
                    central storyline of the series.

                <p>
                    The Harry Potter universe features a vast range of magical creatures, from
                    house-elves and hippogriffs to dragons and phoenixes. Some creatures are
                    friendly and intelligent, while others are dangerous and unpredictable. The
                    Ministry of Magic regulates magical creatures, classifying them according to
                    threat level and magical ability.

                <h3>A global phenomenon that shaped a generation.</h3>
                <p>
                    The Harry Potter series consists of seven novels published between 1997 and
                    2007. The books became an international success, translated into dozens of
                    languages and adapted into blockbuster films. Beyond entertainment, the series
                    explores themes of friendship, courage, prejudice, and sacrifice. Today, Harry
                    Potter remains one of the most influential literary franchises in modern
                    history.
